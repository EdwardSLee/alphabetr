\title{Create a synthetic set of clones with a specific underlying clonal structure}
\usage{
create_clones(numb_beta = 1000, dual = 0.1, alpha_sharing = c(0.816,
  0.085, 0.021, 0.007, 0.033, 0.005, 0.033), beta_sharing = c(0.859, 0.076,
  0.037, 0.019, 0.009))
}
\arguments{
\item{numb_beta}{The number of unique betas in the clonal population}

\item{dual}{The proportion of clones that are dual TCR clones, i.e. has two
distinct alpha chains}

\item{alpha_sharing}{A vector where the ith position represents the
proportion of alpha chains that are shared by i clones; alpha chains can
be shared by up to 6 clones}

\item{beta_sharing}{A vector where the ith position represents the
proportion of beta chains that are shared by i clones; beta chains can be
shared by up to 5 clones}
}
\value{
A n by 3 matrix, where n is the total number of clones, column 1 is
   the beta index of the clone, column 2 is the alpha1 index of the clone,
   and column 3 is the alpha2 index of the clone. If the clone is a single
   TCR clone, then col 1 and col2 will have the same value. If the clone is
   a dual TCR clone, then the indices in col 1 and col 2 will be different.
}
\description{
\code{create_clones()} creates a set of (beta, alpha1, alpha2) triples that
   represents the indices of the chains of clones. The function will take a
   fixed number of unique beta chains that are in the T cell population, and
   then use the degree of beta and alpha sharing to determine the number of
   unique alpha chains in the populations. These chains will then be randomly
   assigned to each other, with a proportion of them being dual TCR clones
   (i.e. alpha1 != alpha2), forming our random list of clones with their
   chain indices.

   # Creating a population containing 1000 beta chains; 30\% of clones with
   # dual TCRs; 75\% beta shared by one clone, 20\% by two clones, 5\% by three
   # clones; 80\% alpha chains shared by one clone, 15\% by two clones, and 5\%
   # by three clones

                              alpha_sharing = c(0.80, 0.15, 0.05),
                              beta_sharing = c(0.75, 0.20, 0.05))
